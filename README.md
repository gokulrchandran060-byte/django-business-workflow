# Business Workflow Management System

A Django REST Framework backend application that implements
a controlled business workflow using Django ORM.

This project focuses on enforcing workflow rules and validations
instead of simple CRUD operations.

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Django ORM
- Git

---

##  Core Concept

Tasks move through a predefined workflow:

CREATED → IN_PROGRESS → DONE

Invalid transitions are blocked at the business logic layer.

---

##  Key Features

- RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework
- Workflow state transitions with validation
- Service layer for business logic
- ORM-based filtering, validation, and updates
- Status-based querying using Django ORM
- Structured logging for workflow actions
- Clean separation of concerns

---

##  Architecture Overview

Client  
→ Versioned API URLs (`/api/v1/`)  
→ DRF API Layer (Views & Serializers)  
→ Service Layer (Workflow Rules)  
→ Django ORM  
→ PostgreSQL Database  

---

##  ORM Usage Highlights

This project makes explicit use of Django ORM features:

- `all()` – list workflow items
- `filter()` – status-based querying
- `exists()` – efficient validation
- `update()` – state updates without full object reload
- `order_by()` – latest-first ordering

##  API Endpoints (v1)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/tasks/` | List tasks (supports status filter) |
| POST | `/api/v1/tasks/` | Create new task |
| GET | `/api/v1/tasks/<id>/` | Retrieve task |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/tasks/<id>/` | Delete task safely |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/tasks/<id>/status/` | Update task status |

---

##  Workflow Rules

- CREATED → IN_PROGRESS (Accepted)
- IN_PROGRESS → DONE (Accepted)
- CREATED → DONE (Rejected)
- DONE → any (Rejected)

Invalid transitions return a clear error response.

---

##  Logging & Error Handling

- INFO logs for successful workflow actions
- WARNING logs for invalid transitions
- Clean HTTP error responses for clients

---

##  Project Focus

This project focuses on backend fundamentals, ORM usage,
and business workflow enforcement.

Infrastructure-level scaling concepts are understood
but not implemented.
